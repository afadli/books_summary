# Chapter 1

## Restate te problem:
In some cases, a problem that looks very difficult may seem easy when stated in a different way or using different terms. Restating a problem is like circling the base of a hill that you must climb;

## Divide the problem:
Finding a way to divide a problem into steps or phases can make the problem much easier. If you can divide a problem into two pieces, you might think that each piece would be half as difficult to solve as the original whole, but usually, itâ€™s even easier than that.

## Start with what you know 
In the same way, when programming, you should try to start with what you already know how to do and work outward from there. Once you have divided the problem up into pieces, for example, go ahead and complete any
pieces you already know how to code. Having a working partial solution may spark ideas about the rest of the problem. Also, as you may have noticed, a common theme in problem solving is making useful progress to build confidence that you will ultimately complete the task. By starting with what you know, you build confidence and momentum toward the goal.

## Reduce the problem:
With this technique, when faced with a problem you are unable to solve, you reduce the scope of the problem, by either adding or removing constraints, to produce a problem that you do know how to solve.

# Chapter 2

## First programming problem:
